NEU are the angles for every pixel with UTM coordinates on the last two columns
csk is for CosmoSKYMED
s1 is for Sentinel 
A and D are respectively for Ascending and Descending
U and E are respectively for Up and East component
UE is only for T that is for Time and is representing the time vector for both Up and East component
TS is for TimeSeries where the first two columns are the UTM coordinates of every pixel and from the third its TS 

e.g.:   - TcskA = Time for Ascending orbit of CosmoSKYMED
	- NEUs1D = angles N,E,U, for Descending orbit of sentinel
